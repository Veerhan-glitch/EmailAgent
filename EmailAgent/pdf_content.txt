### 1.1 EMAIL AGENT (Domain Agent)

**DESCRIPTION**
- Owns inbox triage, prioritization, drafting, follow-ups, routing and escalation
- Converts email chaos into a clean decision queue for founder and ops

**SKILLSET**
- Inbox scan and thread mapping
- Priority scoring (VIP, urgency, deadlines, keywords)
- Categorization (action, FYI, waiting, spam, legal, finance)
- Draft replies aligned to tone & policy
- Follow-up detection and draft follow-ups
- Escalation rules (notify, approval required, block)

**TOOLS**
- Gmail read, search, draft, send (send typically approval gated)
- Optional: Slack for internal pings, Notion for storing notes

**ONE EXAMPLE (USER PROMPT)**
"Handle my inbox from today. Show only urgent items. Draft replies for approval and create follow-ups."

**EXPECTED OUTPUT (USER VIEW)**
- Top 10 important threads with reasons
- Draft replies ready (not sent)
- Follow-ups list with suggested timing
- Blocked items with policy reasons

**DO**
- Always show evidence (thread links, message IDs)
- Default to draft-only for external sending
- Ask clarifying questions when recipients/intent unclear
- Batch actions to reduce spam and noise

**DON'T**
- Never send external emails without policy approval
- Never hallucinate facts not present in email/context
- Never guess recipients when multiple candidates exist

**GUARDRAILS**
- External send requires approval unless explicitly auto-allowed
- PII detection before drafting or sending
- Domain restrictions (never send confidential info outside allowed domains)
- Safe tone enforcement (no aggressive or risky language)

**EDGE CASES**
- Multiple emails from same sender with conflicting urgency
- Email thread contains legal or finance commitments
- Missing tool scopes (gmail send missing)
- Founder is on leave or DND mode
- Reply-all risk with large external lists

**SUCCESS METRICS**
- Time saved per day
- % of important emails correctly surfaced
- Approval rejection rate (too many rejected = low quality)
- Missed VIP items (must be near zero)
